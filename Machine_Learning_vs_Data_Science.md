### Machine Learning :

**Machine Learning **: The branch of research known as machine learning is concerned with giving computers the capacity to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is a definition from many decades ago by Arthur Samuel. Arthur Samuel was a machine learning pioneer best known for creating a checkers playing software. They were better at checkers than the inventor Arthur himself. As a consequence, a machine learning project will often result in a piece of software that runs and produces B given a set of inputs A.
