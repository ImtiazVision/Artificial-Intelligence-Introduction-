### Machine Learning :

**Machine Learning**: The branch of research known as machine learning is concerned with giving computers the capacity to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is a definition from many decades ago by Arthur Samuel. Arthur Samuel was a machine learning pioneer best known for creating a checkers playing software. They were better at checkers than the inventor Arthur himself. As a consequence, a machine learning project will often result in a piece of software that runs and produces B given a set of inputs A.

### Data Science : 

**Data Science** : The practice of analyzing huge amounts of data to extract knowledge and insight that leads to actionable decisions is referred to as data science. The scope of data science is the extraction of information and insights from data. Data science answers the following questions :

  - What type of knowledge?
  - How is insight obtained?
  - Which actionable choice is made?

### Deep Learning : 

**Deep Learning** : is the expansion of computational structures known as neural networks. It is a strong technique for supervised learning or A to B mappings. Learning strong representations is key to deep learning.
