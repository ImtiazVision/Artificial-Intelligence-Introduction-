### Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a machine learning method. Labeled data (data that has been labeled with the correct outcome) is used by supervised learning systems to predict outcomes for unseen data.

A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and provides an inferred function that is then used to map new samples. This allows the system to correctly assign class labels to previously unknown situations.
