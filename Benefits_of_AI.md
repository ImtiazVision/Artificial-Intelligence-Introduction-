### Benefits of AI : 

- **Reduced Human Error**: One of the most important benefits of AI is its capacity to drastically decrease errors while enhancing accuracy and precision.

- **Take risks rather than Humans**: Another significant benefit of AI is that it allows humans to sidestep many difficulties by delegating them to AI robots. Machines with metal bodies are strong in nature and can endure unfavorable atmospheres, whether they are defusing a bomb, traveling to space, or exploring the deepest depths of the seas.

- **24*7 Availability**: AI can continue to work eternally with no breaks. They think far quicker than humans and can accomplish many tasks at once with consistent results. With the assistance of AI algorithms, they may even do tedious repetitive tasks.

- **Assisting with Repetitive Tasks** : We can use artificial intelligence to successfully automate repetitive operations like sending thank-you emails and inspecting specific papers for errors, and even remove "dull" chores from people's workloads, freeing them up to be more creative.
