# Artificial-Intelligence-Introduction

### Artificial Intelligence definition 

**Artificial Intelligence(AI)**: refers to computers' capacity to do activities that would ordinarily need human intellect. It refers to non-biological organisms that display sophisticated, goal-directed behavior. This involves visual perception, decision making, voice recognition, and language translation. The system is taught rather than explicitly programmed in machine learning, which distinguishes it from conventional programming. Rather of explicitly coding a set of rules to produce an output, we instruct the computer to find solutions.

AI is the imitation of human intelligence processes by technology, primarily computers. AI is used in expert systems, natural language processing, voice recognition, and machine vision.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is now ubiquitous. Though AI is still in its infancy, there are some clear advantages and downsides to society.


### AI types : 

AI is really two concepts. Almost all current AI advancement is ANI, or artificial narrow intelligence. It may be a smart speaker, a self-driving vehicle, a web search engine or AI applications in farming or manufacturing. These AIs are one trick ponies, but when used correctly, they may be quite helpful.

AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a subset of AI. That is the aim of AI. They can accomplish whatever a person can do, and maybe more.
